                    <p>There are many things you can do to prevent getting hacked.  
                        Use a random password generator or random passphrase (ex. &AzebraisaAstripedfunhorseIthinkitsCUTE&)
                        Be careful where you click!  Be on the lookout for phishing scams.
                        Only make online purchases from reputable vendors with website URL starting with https://.
                        Turn on multifactor identification.  Change passwords regularly.
                        Don't use the same password for multiple logins.  Better yet, use a password manager.
                        Keep your apps and OS updated.  Only download reputable apps from app store or Google Play; check reviews.
                        Delete old accounts you no longer use.
                        Encrypt the data on your phone.
                        Use a reputable antivirus software.
                        Turn off bluetooth when not in use.
                        If you have important or sensitive files, keep them backed up in a separate server, and don't disclose the location to untrusted parties.

                        Be sure to change the default password immediately upon logging in.  By default, PRTG will run on port 80 for HTTP and port 433 for HTTPS, which can cause issues.  You 
                    can change the port number in the PRTG administration tool.</p>

                        The LockBit 2.0 ransomware (a notorious ransomware virus designed for use against organizations)
                         is now trying to recruit corporate insiders to help them breach networks. 
                        In return, the insider is promised millions of dollars.

                    Now you can purchase RaaS (Ransomware as a Service) developed by the sophisticated BlackMatter operation. 
                    BlackMatter is believed to be a rebranding of the notorius DarkSide and REvil, which fell off the radar after the
                    highly publicized Kaseya and Colonial Pipeline ransomware attacks.
